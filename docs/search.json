    "text": "The Port of Los Angeles is the largest container port in the United States and a key gateway for U.S.‚ÄìChina trade across the Pacific. As a hub in the global supply chain, its monthly container throughput (measured in TEUs) reflects both U.S. trade activity and broader forces shaping global commerce. Changes in throughput affect shipping companies, retailers, manufacturers, and consumers, making it an important indicator of economic resilience.\nThis project analyzes the monthly dynamics of Los Angeles port throughput from four perspectives. The first is the structure of trade flows, including loaded imports, loaded exports, and empty containers. The second examines external cost drivers such as oil prices, the U.S. dollar index, and the RMB/USD exchange rate. The third focuses on shocks to the supply chain, including COVID-19, tariff actions, and congestion events. The fourth looks at financial markets and domestic demand through indicators such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, and U.S. retail sales.\nBy combining these perspectives, the study explores seasonal patterns, structural breaks, and external influences on U.S. maritime trade. The analysis of the Port of Los Angeles highlights both the vulnerabilities and resilience of U.S.‚ÄìChina trade and its role in the global supply chain.",

Similarly, Morales-Ram√≠rez et al.¬†(2025) apply SARIMA to forecast national port cargo movements and confirm its robustness at the macro level.

UNCTAD (2010) provides evidence that oil price fluctuations significantly affect container and dry bulk freight rates, underscoring fuel costs as a major determinant of shipping dynamics. More recently, Choi et al.¬†(2020) demonstrate asymmetric and nonlinear dependence between oil prices and freight rates, suggesting that cost shocks transmit unevenly across market conditions.

Notteboom, Pallis, and Rodrigue (2021) compare the pandemic with the 2008‚Äì2009 financial crisis, concluding that COVID-19 caused structural breaks in port operations while also accelerating adaptation and resilience mechanisms. The Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (Benigno et al., 2022) provides a quantitative measure of supply chain stress, widely adopted to capture pandemic-era disruptions. Meanwhile, congestion events at Los Angeles/Long Beach in 2021, where up to 79 containerships were queued offshore (Seatrade Maritime, 2021; Marine Exchange of Southern California, 2021), illustrate operational bottlenecks that can be modeled using event dummies or interrupted time series approaches. Tariff actions under Section 301 also represent critical policy shocks affecting U.S.‚ÄìChina trade. Together, these shocks justify modeling structural breaks and intervention variables in the analysis of port TEUs.",

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Transportation Average capture investor sentiment and expectations about logistics activity, while U.S. retail sales measure household demand for imported goods. Literature on transportation finance suggests that sector-specific indices serve as forward-looking proxies of logistics conditions. Integrating these indicators into SARIMAX or VAR models enables the study to assess whether financial signals anticipate container throughput movements at the Port of Los Angeles.\nIn summary, prior research on seasonal forecasting, energy linkages, supply chain disruptions, and financial-demand factors provides a solid foundation for this study.
